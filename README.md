## Shader Editor - Cem Alemdar

https://a3-calemdar.glitch.me/



- the goal of the application is to create your own custom shader by changing slider values
- It took me a long time to figure out how to make the shaders dynamic
- I chose Passport authentication to learn about username and password handling in databases
- I chose MongoDB for my database to learn more about it
- I used bootswatch which is a theme based bootstrap CSS template
- Middlewares used:
  - Ejs; to use the template structures it allows
  - Mongoose; to implement MongoDB
  - Express session; to keep track of the client session
  - Flash; to show error messages
  - Bcryptjs; to encrypt user passwords

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used GLSL to write dynamic shaders using Pixi.js
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I used MongoDB for storing the data
- **Tech Achievement 3**: I used EJS to keep views structured nicely

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I require users to log in before being able to go to the pages they want by changing the URL
- **Design Achievement 2**: I tried to give as much information to the user as possible about what they could do, or why something didn't work (flash messages, input value placeholders)
